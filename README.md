# caffe-model
Python script to generate CNN models on Caffe

# Models
1. Lenet
 
   Lenet was presented by Yann LeCun in [Backpropagation applied to handwritten zip code recognition](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~welling/teaching/273ASpring09/lecun-89e.pdf).

2. AlexNet (and CaffeNet in alexnet.py)
  
   AlexNet was initially described in [ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional
Neural Networks] (http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf)

   Implemention of CaffeNet is referenced by [caffe/caffenet.py](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/examples/pycaffe/caffenet.py)


# Acknowlegement

I greatly thank [Yangqing Jia](https://github.com/Yangqing) and [BVLC group](https://www.github.com/BVLC/caffe) for developing Caffe

And I also thank the authors of CNN models
